# Ingenico Connect Go SDK

## Introduction

The Go SDK helps you to communicate with the [Ingenico Connect](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/) Server API. It's primary features are:

* convenient go wrapper around the API calls and responses
    * marshalls Go request structs to HTTP requests
    * unmarshalls HTTP responses to Go response structs or Go exceptions
* handling of all the details concerning authentication
* handling of required meta data

Its use is demonstrated by an example for each possible call. The examples execute a call using the provided API keys.

See the [Ingenico Connect Developer Hub](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/server/go/) for more information on how to use the SDK.

## Requirements

Go version 1.7 is required. In addition, the following packages are required:
* [Gabs](https://github.com/Jeffail/gabs)

## Examples

This repository also contains some example code. This code is contained in the examples folder.

## Installation

### Source

To install the latest version of this repository, run the following command from a terminal:

    go get github.com/Ingenico-ePayments/connect-sdk-go

### Release

#### Go 1.10 and below

Because `go get` can only get the latest version of the repository, and that version could contain breaking changes for new major versions, this package should be used with one of the tools from [Go package managers](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PackageManagementTools#pkg-copy-built-using-gopath-modification-supports-fetching-specific-version) that support it. We recommend using [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide). This package manager will automatically handle all dependencies of this project.

#### Go 1.11 and above
Go 1.11 added module support and with that support for versions in `go get`. This means you can add `@version` to the go get command to get a specific version. For example `go get github.com/Ingenico-ePayments/connect-sdk-go@1.29.0` will download version 1.29.0 of the SDK. See the releases page for an overview of available releases.

## Running tests

There are two types of tests: unit tests and integration tests. The unit tests will work out-of-the-box; for the integration tests some configuration is required. First, some environment variables need to be set:

* `connect.api.apiKeyId` for the API key id to use. This can be retrieved from the Configuration Center.
* `connect.api.secretApiKey` for the secret API key to use. This can be retrieved from the Configuration Center.
* `connect.api.merchantId` for your merchant ID.
* `connect.api.proxyUrl` for the URL to the proxy to use (optional). If set, it should be in the form `scheme://[userinfo@]host[:port]`. Examples: `http://proxy.example.org`, `http://user:pass@proxy.example.org`, `http://proxy.example.org:3128`.

The following commands can now be executed from the root directory of the SDK folder to execute the tests:

* Unit tests:
    
    ```
    go test ./...
    ```
*  Both unit and integration tests:
    
    ```
    go test -tags=integration  ./...
    ```
